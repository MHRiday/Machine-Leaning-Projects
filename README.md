# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way human learn. In simple, Machine learning is a process to teach computer without being explicitly programmed.

## Approaches
Machine Learning approaches are divided into three categories. 
- Supervised Learning : Supervised Learning is a category of machine learning algorithms and it uses well-defined labeled datasets to train the algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. Common applications of supervised learning : Predictive Analysis, Image and Object detection and recognition, Customer sentiment analysis etc.

- Unsupervised Learning : Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms discover hidden pattern or data grouping in a dataset with no labels and minimal human intervention. This approach is ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation etc. 

- Reinforcement Learning : Reinforcement Learning is a method of machine learning where an agant learns to make decision over time with consequences. It has a broad range of applications : game playing, recommendations, system optimization etc.
